Brrp, brrp
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Know you need me (Get it, ah)
Say you want a freak, sir, might see it
You wanna be color, bright and peachy
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on (Brrp, brrp, bow)
I'll stay today like it's your birthday
You tell me you just want a piece of the cake (Birthday cake)
I just might let you get some today (Huh)
'Cause the way you been grinding on me
You got me feeling some type of way
And I'm into all these moves
Press this McQueen and face me real tight
I got your hands taking a ride on the wild side
Know what they say about girls from this size
You wanna risk it all
Every time you see me with my little black dress on,
Know you need me (Get it, ah)
Say you want a freak, sir, might see it
You wanna be color, bright and peachy
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on (Bow, bow)
I know you wondering what's under here (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sweet pineapples, just imagined it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just a dirty little teaser (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Type of love that have you coming back (Hold up)
Press this McQueen and face me real tight
I got your hands taking a ride on the wild side
Know what they say about girls from this size
You wanna risk it all
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Know you need me (Get it, ah)
Say you want a freak, sir, might you see it
You wanna be color, bright and peachy (Oh, ayy)
Baby, you should that I ain't easy (Brrp, brrp)
Es mucha tentaci¨®n
T¨² puedes ver pero no tocar
Usa tu imaginaci¨®n
Que nunca sabes qu¨¦ va a pasar
Ac¨¦rcate a m¨ª un poquito m¨¢s, oh oh oh
Si te portas bien te lo voy a dar
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Know you need me (Get it, ah)
Say you want a freak, sir, might you see it
You wanna be color, bright and peachy (Huh, ayy)
Baby, you should that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on
In my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on (Bow, bow)
